# ZTH1-Assembler
Assembly-language cross-compiler for the ZTH1 CPU

This is an assembler (assembly-language cross-compiler) for the ZTH1 RISC CPU (see the Zythium-1 repository). It has been written in C-language and runs on Linux/Unix. It creates .mif files for the instruction ROM and the data RAM of ZTH1-based machines (Zythium-1 and VectorUGo-2) implemented on a Maximator FPGA board. A manual in PDF is included, as well as an example of code (to display ASCII characters on an HDMI monitor).

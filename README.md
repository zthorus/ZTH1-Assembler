# ZTH1-Assembler
Assemly language cross-compiler for the ZTH1 CPU

This is an assembler (assembly language cross-compiler) for the ZTH1 RISC CPU (see dedicated repository). It has been wrotten in C-language and runs on Linux/Unix. It creates .mif files for the instruction ROM and the data RAM of the ZTH1 micro-computer implemented on a Maximator FPGA board (see the ZTH1 repository). A manual in PDF is included, as well as an example of code (to display ASCII characters on an HDMI monitor).
